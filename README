This program is a fork of liblwmqtt developed by Filipe Varela.
You can find the original project on <http://code.google.com/p/liblwmqtt/>.

libemqtt aims to be an embedded C client library for the MQTT protocol.


For debugging MQTT development it's possible to use
Wireshark-MQTT (https://github.com/menudoproblema/Wireshark-MQTT)
